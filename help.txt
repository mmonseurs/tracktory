flactory (https://github.com/mmonseurs/flactory)
------------------------------------------------

Usage:
  node flactory.js [options]

Options:
  --dir=<path>             Directory containing audio files (default: current directory)
  --filetype=<ext>         Audio file extension: 'flac' or 'mp3' (default: 'flac')
  --convert                Convert provided filetype to mp3 using ffmpeg. Will always be executed first.
  --coverart               Embed cover art into audio files
  --resize                 Resize cover to a 500x500 version before embedding (keeps original cover file)
  --lyrics                 Attempt to fetch lyrics from lrclib and save as sidecar files
  --preferlocal            Prefer local/existing lyrics over online sources
  --help, -h               Show this help message and exit

Examples:
  node flactory.js --filetype=mp3 --coverart --lyrics
    ▶ Process MP3 files in the current directory, embed cover art and lyrics

  node flactory.js --dir=./albums --filetype=flac --coverart
    ▶ Embed coverart into FLAC files from './albums' only

Notes:
  • You must have required dependencies installed.
  • Optional tools like 'eyeD3' or 'metaflac' are only required when working with that filetype.
  • Make sure your files are tagged appropriately! The bare minimum is: artist, album, title.
  • Converting and fetching lyrics is fine with whatever directory structure you employ. However for album covers to work, you need to have each album as its own directory. "/artist/album" or "/artist - album" is both fine.
  • Cover art should be placed in the target directory.
  • Use the preferlocal flag if you already have lyrics that you don't want overwritten.
  • When converting files to MP3, don't forget to specify --filetype. You might need to run flactory a second time to proceed with embedding covers and fetching lyrics. For example:
    • node flactory.js --convert --coverart --lyrics
      • will convert all flac files to mp3, and then embed covers in the original flac files, not resulting mp3 files. Lyrics will be fine since converting will result in identical filenames.
    • node flactory.js --convert --lyrics && node flactory.js --filetype=mp3 --coverart
      • will convert flac files to mp3, fetch lyrics, and then embed covers in the mp3 files.
